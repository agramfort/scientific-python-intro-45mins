During this why & how you will learn the basics of Python
for scientific computing. I will explain how Python
can be used as a simple calculator and also how to use it to
do linear algebra and plots for publication ready figures.
Python is free and comes will very efficient libraries for
numerical computation making it a serious alternative to
matlab. If time permits I will demo some neat features of Python
like parallel computing, interactive debugging and code testing.
